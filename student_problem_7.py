# SP7: JSON

# You are given a file called 'courses.json'.
# It contains information about several courses and the students enrolled in them.

# Write a program that:
# 1. Loads 'courses.json'.

# 2. For each student in each course:
#    - Computes the average of their grades
#    - Adds a new field called "average"

# 3. For each course:
#    - Computes the course average (average of all
#      student averages)
#    - Adds a field called "course_average"

# 4. Writes the updated data to a new file called
#    'courses_with_averages.json'

# HINY:
# Use the json module.
